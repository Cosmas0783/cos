1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,910
OK, welcome to Basic Arithmetic in this lesson, we're going to take a look at just some basic math.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,260
And this is really, really important to know because we can do some really cool things with simple,

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,420
simple mathematics.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,760
So, for example, we're going to be talking about addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,180
exponents, and this thing called Modulus, which is really just a reminder.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,910
It's a it's a it's a really fancy word for remainder.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,210
And so what you see in front of me here is I have just gone to file open and I opened a whole folder

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,560
called Python 101.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,480
And you can do this on your voice code as well.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,190
And it just opened up this folder for me.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,070
So all of my working files are going to be on the side in on the left here.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,890
And so I want to go over to view and open up my terminal again.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,930
And this way, we've got our files on the left and we have our terminal at the bottom and we can write

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,490
some code up top, up top in here.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,010
And so let's take a look at some basic arithmetic.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,940
Now, there's two ways we can execute Python.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,750
We can execute Python in a DCPI file like we did in the last lesson where we had Hello World or in your

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,260
terminal.

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,860
Wherever you want to use that, you can simply type Python.

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,370
And if you want to get out of this python shell, we can just type quit opening and closing parentheses

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,570
and that will quit it for us.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,540
So I could type Python three point nine and you can see that the first one was using Python three point

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,010
eight because I haven't made that alias yet.

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,900
I said I was going to but I haven't got around to it yet.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,000
And this one is Python three point nine.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,380
And so now we can do some basic arithmetic in here.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,230
Let's go ahead and move this up.

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,010
And let's do some basic arithmetic so we could do like five.

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,220
Plus five is going to be 10, and this is just executing simple python for us right in our python shell.

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,750
So that's a decision.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,760
We just use a plus sign.

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,420
Subtraction is very, very similar.

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,940
Let's go ahead and make this just a wee bit bigger here.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,080
We could do like 99, minus 11.

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:05,040
That's going to give us 88, four times four is going to be 16 and we just use an asterisk.

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,020
So on a standard North American English keyboard, you use shift eight and that gives you this little

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,590
character here.

38
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,380
And so when I hit enter, that's going to be 16 division is just a slash just like that.

39
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,640
So we could do 100 divided by 25 and that's going to give us four.

40
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,790
And you can actually see that gave us 4.0, that's technically a float, that's not an integer.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,490
We're going to talk about these in the future.

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,190
Now to clear your terminal, let's say I write a bunch of stuff and gives me errors.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,960
I can just hit control.

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,690
L control l tends to clean out the terminal for me.

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,480
So that's what I'm going to be doing in the future.

46
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,870
Now, let's talk about exponents.

47
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,900
We could do four to the power of four, that's to multiplication sign side by side.

48
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,260
That is the power of.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,020
So in other languages, it sometimes looks like this.

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,740
Four to the power of four in Python.

51
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,000
It's four star star four.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,330
And that gives us an exponent.

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,910
So this is going to be four times four times four, which in my mind is going to be 64.

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,530
Nope.

55
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,510
I was super, super wrong to 56.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,200
This is why we let computers do mathematics for us.

57
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,430
And then we have this weird one called modules, modules, modules, modules.

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,920
And all this is going to do is give us a remainder.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,960
So if we did ten divided by three, we're going to see three point three three three three three three

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,790
three five.

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,850
It's a weird one.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,650
So let's say we wanted the remainder.

63
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,240
So three goes into ten, three times or three, six, nine and it has a remainder of one.

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
So we can do modules here.

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,300
And to get that remainder, we use the Modula sign, which is really simply a sign.

66
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,190
So we do modulus three and this is going to give us one.

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,410
And again, that goes three, six, nine.

68
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,120
And then it basically takes that last number and says ten minus nine.

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,020
And that gives us our remainder.

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,060
And so if you remember doing long division, well, maybe not remember how to do long division, but

71
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,410
if you remember long division from school, it's basically that it's going to give us the remainder

72
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,260
very easily.

73
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,470
We don't have to do any sort of long division.

74
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,490
And in fact, a lot of people think you need to know a lot of math to get into Web development or programming

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,330
or into Python.

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,640
Truth is, you do not.

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,800
And here is the case in point.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,500
I could do something like 88 Modulus, six point four.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,020
Now, I don't remember how to do long division.

80
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,800
It's a fairly simple thing in mathematics, but I just don't remember how to do it.

81
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,620
That was a long time ago for me, and that was an unexpected indent.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,840
If you ever see that, you probably have an extra space in there.

83
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,670
This is going to give us a modulus of four point seven nine nine, nine, nine and five.

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,770
And so I don't need to know long division anymore, the computer knows how to do it, and that is the

85
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,840
nice thing about pretty much all programming languages, not just Python, but all programming languages

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,620
can do this.

87
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,570
So what I would like you to do is go ahead and try some basic addition.

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,360
Subtraction.

89
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,820
Division multiplication.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,540
Try modulus and also try exponents.

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,840
Now, truth be told, you're not actually going to be using modulus and exponents all that often, you

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,900
probably won't even really use multiplication all that often or maybe even division all that often in

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,620
web development.

94
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,140
But in data science, you're going to use these all the time.

95
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,100
And these are very, very important, especially when you get into things like algorithms.

96
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,050
If you ever wanted to get into algorithms now in Web development, you don't need to get into algorithms.

97
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,250
It's not really all that important unless you're working for Google and you're working with Google's

98
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,250
search division, which is pretty unique.

99
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,560
Most Web development, you just you don't need that.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,730
So go ahead and give addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus and exponents a try,

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,140
make sure you open up your Python terminal.

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,880
So again, quit.

103
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,590
And I just went into Python and that goes straight into my Python terminal for me or my python shell,

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,010
as I call it, to the python shell.

105
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,010
And to quit, you just quit parentheses and that gets you out when you're done that.

106
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,350
Let's head on over to the next lesson where we learn about variables.
